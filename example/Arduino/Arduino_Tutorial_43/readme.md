# Libraries Overview

## **Arduino_GFX-master**
Arduino GFX is a graphics library that provides support for drawing text, shapes, and images on displays connected to Arduino boards.

## **BLE**
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) libraries facilitate wireless communication between devices using BLE technology, commonly used in IoT projects.

## **ESP32-audioI2S-master**
ESP32 Audio I2S library enables audio processing capabilities on ESP32 microcontrollers via the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) bus interface.

## **FFat**
FFat stands for FatFs File System, which allows managing files stored on storage devices such as SD cards within embedded systems.

## **FS**
File System (FS) libraries provide functions for organizing, storing, retrieving, and manipulating files on various types of storage media.

## **lvgl**
LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) offers an easy-to-use graphical user interface framework designed specifically for embedded systems.

## **SD**
Secure Digital (SD) card libraries handle operations related to reading from and writing to SD cards, often used for persistent data storage.

## **SD_MMC**
Similar to the SD library but tailored for MultiMediaCard (MMC), another type of flash memory storage device.

## **SPI**
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) libraries manage serial communications protocols allowing multiple devices to communicate synchronously over short distances.

## **SPIFFS**
SPI Flash File System (SPIFFS) is a lightweight file system optimized for NOR flash memories typically found in microcontroller-based projects.

## **Ticker**
Ticker libraries are responsible for creating periodic tasks or interrupts at regular intervals, useful for time-sensitive applications.

## **U8g2**
U8g2 is a versatile display driver library supporting numerous monochrome OLED/LCD displays with different resolutions and interfaces.

## **UI**
User Interface (UI) folders may contain resources like icons, fonts, themes, layouts, etc., essential for developing visually appealing interfaces.

## **WiFiClientSecure**
WiFiClientSecure extends WiFiClient by adding SSL/TLS encryption features ensuring secure network connections when transmitting sensitive information.

## **Wire**
Wire library facilitates two-wire serial communication protocol known as I2C, widely adopted in connecting sensors, modules, and peripherals.

## **XPT2046_Touchscreen**
XPT2046 Touchscreen library interacts with resistive touchscreens equipped with XPT2046 controller chips translating touch inputs into actionable data.

## **lv_conf.h**
Lv_conf.h configures settings for LVGL library defining memory allocations, enabled/disabled features, default styles among others impacting app's functionality & aesthetics.

## **touch.h**
Touch.h likely defines functions and structures pertaining to touchscreen interactions handling touch events detection and interpretation processes.

## **UI-4.3-BLUE.rar**
UI-4.3-BLUE.rar appears to be a compressed archive containing UI assets probably intended for use with a specific version of a project or product named "UI-4.3-BLUE".
